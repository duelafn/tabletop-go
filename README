===========
tabletop-go
===========

Go game built on the kivy framework (https://github.com/kivy/kivy).

While primarily designed for table-top (surface) computers, this
application should work fine on touchpads, phones, and desktop/laptop
computers as long as you can install the kivy framework.



Status
======

The game is currently playable. Interface should be functional if not
always friendly. Some oddities can come up if captured stones are not
immediately removed from the board (this will be fixed in a later release).



TODO
====

* options: theme (dynamic + custom path), show turns, auto-capture
* undo, redo, checkpointing (gnugo?)
* force dead stone clearing
* Rule enforcement (gnugo, optional?): Ko, self-capture, ...
* Atari warning (optional)
* Help/usage
* Fullscreen toggle without modesetting
* gnugo: scoring / komi
